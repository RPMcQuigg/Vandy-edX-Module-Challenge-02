# Vandy-edX-Module-Challenge-02
Created the beginning of a portfolio using advanced CSS code.

HTML - added a work nav bar, an about section with info and picture of me, project section with link to previously deployed pages, and contact section with active link to my GitHub

CSS - Both nav bar and about sections function as wanted. Have run into unknown bug with the project and contact section that has both section pulled to the right side of the screen. Project section has further issues the disired flow of project being from left to right while deployed code show right to left. Bugs occured in the pass hour of writing this(current time 11;20 P.M. Aug 31). Have tried several fixes but have been unable to find the source or sources of the bug.
